# Comments starts with # and span an entire line

# Rulesets are formatted like:
# NAME COUNT 
# S   RULE1
# ...
# S   RULE2
# ;
# 
# NAME is the label, COUNT the number of rules to randomly apply and S the specifier ($ for Comby, £ for RedBaron).
# The three spaces after S are required.
# Different type of rules can be mixed.

# For Comby patterns, consider https://comby.dev/
# For RedBaron, you can execute "redbaron_rules.py" and type ? in the prompt

# " => " transforms all matches
all_return_to_print_comby 1 
$   return :[value] => print(:[value])
;

# " -> " transforms one match
one_return_to_print_comby 1
$   return :[value] -> print(:[value])
;

# Otherwise, you can use RedBaron predefined rules
